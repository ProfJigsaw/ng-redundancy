# ng-redundancy
> This package, when required, forces yours application to be redundant with exit code 0.

## Install
```bash
npm install ng-redundancy
```

## Usage
```javascript
require('ng-redundancy') // smooth right?
```

## Why exit code 0?
This package doesn't discriminate or assume your app is good/bad/buggy. Every app shall be dealt with the same way (eventually).

## Do I need this?
No! If you didn't want (your app) to be made redundant, why require/install?
